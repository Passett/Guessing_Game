# Guessing_Game
Going through some old code I wrote and figured I'd start adding a couple of older projects from when I first started. This is the first program I wrote while going through Al Sweigart's Automate the Boring Stuff.

Looking back at this now, the thing that stands out to me the most if my lack of notes. I have a global variable that's just the string "bugfix" with no notes on it at all, haha.
